good to go. You can delete lib.php out of the admin directory too, if you want, since
it's not used anymore.

### 1.1.2 ###
CHANGED FILES:
- install.php (do not upload if you've already installed the game)
- lib.php
- fight.php
- help.php
- config.php
NEW FILES:
- upgrade_to_112.php
DIRECTIONS:
If you're already using 1.1, upload the files above (except for install.php). Be sure to put your 
database values into the new config.php file. Then run upgrade_to_112.php in your browser. If you're
still using a 1.0.x version, you should first perform the directions for upgrading to 1.1.0,
then 1.1.1, in that order. Then upload the files, then run the upgrade_to_112.php in your browser.
NOTE:
Running the upgrade script should only be done if you did not alter the order in which new spells
are gained. Changes to the actual spells don't matter, only the levels in which they are learned.
The upgrade script will automatically reset spells for all user accounts to their default order.
If you have altered that order, just execute the following two SQL queries in your admin program
of choice.
ALTER TABLE `dk_users` CHANGE `towns` `towns` VARCHAR( 50 ) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE `dk_users` CHANGE `spells` `spells` VARCHAR( 50 ) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL;
Be sure to substitude "dk_users" to your actual table names, if you've changed the prefix.

### 1.1.1 ###
CHANGED FILES:
- users.php
- towns.php
DIRECTIONS:
If you're already using 1.1, you only need to upload the two files listed above. If you are still at a
1.0.x version, you need to do the 1.1.0 stuff listed below as well.

### 1.1.0 ###
CHANGED FILES:
- users.php
- install.php
- index.php
- config.php
- lib.php
- towns.php
- heal.php
- fight.php
- admin/admin.php
- templates/register.php
- templates/login.php
- templates/leftnav.php
- templates/towns.php
NEW FILES:
- templates/verify.php
- templates/lostpassword.php
- templates/changepassword.php
- upgrade_to_110.php
DIRECTIONS:
Version 1.1.0 is a major upgrade. It is suggested you close the game (in Main Settings) before starting
the upgrade. To upgrade, upload the above-listed changed/new files to their proper directories. Re-edit
the proper variables in config.php. Then run upgrade_to_110.php in your browser. After the upgrade script
has completed, log into the game and reset your Main Settings in the control panel.

### 1.0.4 ###
CHANGED FILES:
- config.php
- fight.php
- index.php
- /templates/admin.php
DIRECTIONS:
No database change is necessary. Upload the changed files and re-edit the appropriate variables in
config.php. That's it.

### 1.0.3 ###
CHANGED FILES:
- config.php
- fight.php
- lib.php
- /templates/leftnav.php
NEW FILES:
- help.php
- help_items.php
- help_levels.php
- help_monsters.php
- help_spells.php
DELETED FILES:
- /admin/install.php
- /help/*.*
DIRECTIONS:
No database change is necessary. Upload the changed and new files listed above, delete the extra copy
of install.php from your /admin/ directory, then delete the entire /help/ folder altogether. All
help files have been renamed and moved to the main directory, to get rid of the paths problem that
was occurring. Make sure you re-edit the appropriate variables in config.php too. Note that the
$app_path variable in lib.php is no longer necessary, so it has been removed. config.php is the 
ONLY file you need to edit to make the program work.

### 1.0.2 ###
CHANGED FILES:
- config.php
- fight.php
- lib.php
- install.php
DIRECTIONS:
No database change is necessary. Just upload the files listed above (do not upload install.php if
you already installed the game without any problems) and re-edit the appropriate variables in
config.php. There is a new variable at the top of lib.php that you'll need to edit as well.
