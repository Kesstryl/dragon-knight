	elseif ($do[0] == "pvpfight2") { include('pvpfight.php'); pvpfight2(); }
	elseif ($do[0] == "pvpfight3") { include('pvpfight.php'); pvpfight3($do[1]); }
	elseif ($do[0] == "pvpfight4") { include('pvpfight.php'); pvpfight4($do[1]); }
     //End PVP

#save and close index.php


2. Open templates/towns.php and add lines

<li /><a href="index.php?do=mainfight">Challenge Arena</a>
