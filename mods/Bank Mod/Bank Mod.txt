The Bank mod was made by Gary Schilling and the Send Gold was made 
by JamesXm and it was fused together by Horsley.

Step 1.
Go to phymyadmin and insert this into the SQL tab of your users table:

ALTER TABLE `dk_users` ADD `bank` MEDIUMINT(7) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0


Step 2.
add this in the long list of do functions in index.php

elseif ($do[0] == "bank") { include('bank.php'); bank(); }


Step 3.
Open templates/towns.php and find this line:

<li /><a href="index.php?do=maps">Buy Maps</a>

After that add this line:

<li /><a href="index.php?do=bank">Go to the Bank</a>


Step 4.
make sure bank.php is in your game directory


step 5.
This will add a Bank section in your edit users.

In Admin.php in your route directory

Find in the users function (where the big doquery database insert is):

gold="$gold",

And replace with:

gold="$gold", bank="$bank",


Still in admin.php 

Find in the form tags:

<tr><td width="20%">Gold:</td><td><input type="text" name="gold" size="10" maxlength="8" value="{{gold}}" /></td></tr>

Replace with:

<tr><td width="20%">Gold:</td><td><input type="text" name="gold" size="10" maxlength="8" value="{{gold}}" /></td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Bank:</td><td><input type="text" name="bank" size="10" maxlength="8" value="{{bank}}" /></td></tr>
