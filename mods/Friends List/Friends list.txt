translated and edited by Kesstryl to work with Dragon Knight Updated.
mail function added using code from the Mail Mod.  Text input for adding friends added by Kesstryl.


			Needs Mail Mod in order to send friends private messages

SQL :

CREATE TABLE `dk_friends` (
`id` int(6) NOT NULL auto_increment,
`friendchar` text NOT NULL,
`userchar` text NOT NULL,
`date` text NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;



OPEN Index.php and somewhere right before // Misc functions. ADD :

 
	//friends functions
	elseif ($do[0] == "friendslist") {include('friends.php'); friendslist(); }
	elseif ($do[0] == "friends") { include('friends.php'); friends($do[1]); }
	elseif ($do[0] == "remove_friends") { include('friends.php'); remove_friends($do[1]); }
	elseif ($do[0] == "mailfriend") { include('friends.php'); mailfriend($do[1]); }

	
	
in templates/leftnav.php add:

<a href="index.php?do=friendslist">Friends</a></br>



IN templates/onlinechar.php add :
note - for some reason this line breaks the layout and doesn't display, and should only be used if you know how to fix it ~Kesstryl

<a href="index.php?do=friends:{{charname}}>Add this player in my List Friends</a>








NOTES -

It gives me a blank page. Like the templates and everything is there except the middle is just blank.

Anyone have a patch for this? The link I used to access the page is:
a href="index.php?do=friends

More problems. It only allows you to add yourself. I have 220 registered players and it only says to add my own name. 

Then when I click add I get this,
Unknown column 'date' in 'field list'

Afflicted… 
Add a field dates in dk_friends or replaces :

$query = doquery("SELECT date,friendchar FROM dkm_comments WHERE userchar='".$userrow['charname']."'", "friends");

By :

$query = doquery("SELECT friendchar FROM dkm_comments WHERE userchar='".$userrow['charname']."'", "friends");

And :
$query = doquery("INSERT INTO dkm_comments SET id='', friendchar='".$_POST['friendchar']."', userchar='".$userrow['charname']."'", date='$time'", "friends");

With :

$query = doquery("INSERT INTO dkm_comments SET id='', friendchar='".$_POST['friendchar']."', userchar='".$userrow['charname']."', date='$time'"", "friends");

Really sorry for the errors but if not it goes very well

I update this MOD :D
Posted by masterofollies on 07.07.2007
Now I get this

Table 'rodgameo_game.dkm_comments' doesn't exist
Posted by masterofollies on 07.07.2007
I went ahead and got rid of the entire thing, I fixed 2 things and more errors kept poping up. Oh well
